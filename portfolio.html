		<body>Nick and I created a super awesome and fun game that is heavily inspired by Fruit Ninja. Numerous fruits are tossed into the air and when they're clicked, they slice in half and add a point to the point total. Bombs are also tossed into the air and if they're clicked, the program stops running and the screen displays the words "Game Over."
