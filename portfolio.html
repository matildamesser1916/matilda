		<body>Reese and I created an interactive activity, creating your own garden! It begins with a fully drawn background (grass, flowerbed, bee), then prompts the user on the type and color of flower they want to plant. Then they watch as their garden comes to life!

	<h2>
		<body>Nick and I created a super awesome and fun game that is heavily inspired by Fruit Ninja. Numerous fruits are tossed into the air and when they're clicked, they slice in half and add a point to the point total. Bombs are also tossed into the air and if they're clciked, the program stops running and the screen displays the words "Game Over."
