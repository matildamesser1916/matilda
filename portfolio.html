		<body>Nick and I created a super awesome and fun game that is heavily inspired by Fruit Ninja. Numerous fruits are tossed into the air and when they're clicked, they slice in half and add a point to the point total. Bombs are also tossed into the air and if they're clicked, the program stops running and the screen displays the words "Game Over."

	<h1>Simulation Analysis</h1>
	<img src="Screenshot 2025-05-19 105455.png" height= "350">
	<h3>
		<body>Catelin, Vanessa, and I chose to analyze the frogger simulation. The program runs like the frogger game; the goal is to get the frog across the screen, dodging incoming cars and water by using logs and lily pads. We ran through the program, then analyzed what the different aspects represented and how specific procedures like randomness were used.
